# Agent Notes

This project measures how application-level goodput collapses under load even when SGLang server throughput looks healthy.

## Core Flow

0. Read `README.md` first before running or modifying experiments. Follow the README command flow unless the user explicitly asks for a different low-level path.
1. `run_experiment.py` runs local application workloads against an OpenAI-compatible SGLang endpoint.
2. The SGLang server runs remotely on SSH host `NXC7` and is controlled by this runner through tmux.
3. Results go under `results/<YYMMDD_HHMM>_<session-name>/` (e.g.
   `results/260509_1214_admission_lambda_0p2/`); same `YYMMDD_HHMM_` prefix the
   remote sglang session folder uses. On collision within the same minute the
   runner appends `_v2`, `_v3`, ... With no `--session-name` the dir is just
   `<YYMMDD_HHMM>`.
4. If `--session-name` is provided, the runner builds the prefixed name in
   `condition_session_name()` and passes it to the remote server with
   `--session-name`. The remote sglang prefix-pass is idempotent (sees the
   prefix and uses the name as-is), so both sides agree on the resolved name.
   The runner then fetches the remote runtime session with `rsync`, stores it
   in `server_session/`, and copies `server.stderr*` to the run root.
5. Analysis scripts live in `analysis_scripts/`.
6. Run long experiments from the local tmux `motivation` session.

## Server Ownership

- Treat `run_experiment.py` as the owner of the remote SGLang lifecycle.
- Do not manually start/stop SGLang, create SSH tunnels, or probe remote process state as the first move for normal experiment questions.
- Use `--restart-server` for `single`, `baseline`, and `sweep` runs that need a fresh server.
- Use the default restart behavior for `rate-sweep` and `poisson-sweep`; only use `--no-server-restart` when the user explicitly wants to reuse a running server.
- If a custom admission-control server configuration is needed, pass it through `--sglang-start-cmd` so the runner still owns start/stop/fetch.

## Admission Control Checks

When testing admission-control rejection behavior:

1. Run the smallest useful traffic experiment through `run_experiment.py` (`single` with `--lambda-val`, `--rpm`, or `--concurrency` is usually enough).
2. Use a distinct `--session-name` so local and remote logs can be matched.
3. Inspect `metrics.csv` for failed `chain_call_*` rows (`success=False`, `is_error=True`, and `error_msg`) and `job_summary` rows (`job_completed=False`).
4. Inspect `errors.log` and `agent_logs/` for the client-visible exception text.
5. Inspect fetched `server_session/` or root `server.stderr.log` for server-side admission/reject messages.
6. If a streaming request is rejected, remember that the current client path in `workloads/swe_bench_coding/agent.py` may attempt a non-streaming fallback before marking the call failed.

## Common Commands

Run a Poisson sweep:

```bash
python run_experiment.py \
  --workload swe_bench_coding \
  --mode poisson-sweep \
  --baseline-dir results/baseline_20260424-180204 \
  --lambda-list 0.01,0.02,0.05,0.1,0.2 \
  --duration-min 120 \
  --tau 3.0 \
  --session-name hicache_sweep
```

Postprocess one run:

```bash
python analysis_scripts/parse_application_metrics.py results/<run>
python analysis_scripts/parse_server_logs.py results/<run>
python analysis_scripts/plot_application_metrics.py results/<run>
python analysis_scripts/plot_server_metrics.py results/<run>
```

Build cross-run summaries:

```bash
python analysis_scripts/plot_lambda_slowdown_goodput.py \
  --results-dir results \
  --output-dir results/aggregate_analysis/lambda_slowdown_goodput

python analysis_scripts/analyze_job_call_slowdown_by_release.py \
  --results-dir results \
  --baseline-dir results/baseline_20260424-180204 \
  --output-dir results/aggregate_analysis/job_call_slowdown_by_release_time
```

## Goodput

Baseline latencies are loaded from `--baseline-dir`.

```text
call_goodput = call_latency < baseline_call_latency * tau
job_goodput  = job_latency  < baseline_job_latency  * tau
```

Call/job cross buckets are written to:

```text
analysis/application_call_job_goodput.csv
analysis/application_call_job_goodput_summary.csv
analysis/application_job_call_goodput_summary.csv
```

For `swe_bench_coding_tool_delay`, job timing with and without simulated tool-call intervals is written separately:

```text
analysis/application_job_transition_adjusted.csv
analysis/application_job_transition_adjusted_summary.csv
```

The raw job summary `transition_time` field is the total application-side simulated tool delay for that job. The existing `application_jobs.csv` and `application_summary.csv` should remain compatible with older runs.

For `swe_bench_coding_parallel_tool_delay`, call-level performance still comes from `metrics.csv`. Parallel structure is recorded separately:

```text
parallel_calls.csv
analysis/application_parallel_calls.csv
analysis/application_parallel_rounds.csv
```

Use `execution_round`, not `wave`, for the group of calls that start after the same dependency barrier.

## Editing Guidance

- Keep run output schemas stable unless explicitly asked to migrate them.
- Prefer adding new analysis CSVs over mutating existing CSVs.
- Keep analysis scripts in `analysis_scripts/`.
- Keep cross-run outputs in `results/aggregate_analysis/`, not at the `results/` root.
- Check `workloads/AGENTS.md` and the nearest workload-specific `AGENTS.md` before changing workload adapters.
- Run `python -m py_compile analysis_scripts/*.py run_experiment.py` after moving or editing scripts.
- 사용자가 명확히 실행/수정/테스트를 요청하면 바로 진행한다.
- 요구사항이 애매하거나 실험 설정이 결과를 크게 바꿀 수 있으면 먼저 짧게 확인한다.
- 큰 코드 변경이 필요한 경우에는 먼저 간단한 pseudocode나 코드 스켈레톤을 보여주고 피드백을 받은 뒤 진행한다.
