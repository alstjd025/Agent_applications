# Agent Notes

This project measures how application-level goodput collapses under load even when SGLang server throughput looks healthy.

## Core Flow

0. Read `README.md` first before running or modifying experiments. Follow the README command flow unless the user explicitly asks for a different low-level path.
1. `run_experiment.py` runs local application workloads against an OpenAI-compatible SGLang endpoint.
2. The SGLang server runs remotely on SSH host `NXC7` and is controlled by this runner through tmux.
3. Results go under `results/<YYMMDD_HHMM>_<session-name>/` (e.g.
   `results/260509_1214_admission_lambda_0p2/`); same `YYMMDD_HHMM_` prefix the
   remote sglang session folder uses. On collision within the same minute the
   runner appends `_v2`, `_v3`, ... With no `--session-name` the dir is just
   `<YYMMDD_HHMM>`.
4. If `--session-name` is provided, the runner builds the prefixed name in
   `condition_session_name()` and passes it to the remote server with
   `--session-name`. The remote sglang prefix-pass is idempotent (sees the
   prefix and uses the name as-is), so both sides agree on the resolved name.
   The runner then fetches the remote runtime session with `rsync`, stores it
   in `server_session/`, and copies `server.stderr*` to the run root.
5. Analysis scripts live in `analysis_scripts/`.
6. Run long experiments from the local tmux `motivation` session.

## Server Ownership

- Treat `run_experiment.py` as the owner of the remote SGLang lifecycle.
- Do not manually start/stop SGLang, create SSH tunnels, or probe remote process state as the first move for normal experiment questions.
- Use `--restart-server` for `single`, `baseline`, and `sweep` runs that need a fresh server.
- Use the default restart behavior for `rate-sweep` and `poisson-sweep`; only use `--no-server-restart` when the user explicitly wants to reuse a running server.
- If a custom admission-control server configuration is needed, pass it through `--sglang-start-cmd` so the runner still owns start/stop/fetch.

## Admission Control Checks

When testing admission-control rejection behavior:

1. Run the smallest useful traffic experiment through `run_experiment.py` (`single` with `--lambda-val`, `--rpm`, or `--concurrency` is usually enough).
2. Use a distinct `--session-name` so local and remote logs can be matched.
3. Inspect `metrics.csv` for failed `chain_call_*` rows (`success=False`, `is_error=True`, and `error_msg`) and `job_summary` rows (`job_completed=False`).
4. Inspect `errors.log` and `agent_logs/` for the client-visible exception text.
5. Inspect fetched `server_session/` or root `server.stderr.log` for server-side admission/reject messages.
6. If a streaming request is rejected, remember that the current client path in `workloads/swe_bench_coding/agent.py` may attempt a non-streaming fallback before marking the call failed.

## Common Commands

Run a Poisson sweep:

```bash
python run_experiment.py \
  --workload swe_bench_coding \
  --mode poisson-sweep \
  --baseline-dir results/baseline_20260424-180204 \
  --lambda-list 0.01,0.02,0.05,0.1,0.2 \
  --duration-min 120 \
  --tau 3.0 \
  --session-name hicache_sweep
```

Postprocess one run:

```bash
python analysis_scripts/parse_application_metrics.py results/<run>
python analysis_scripts/parse_server_logs.py results/<run>
python analysis_scripts/plot_application_metrics.py results/<run>
python analysis_scripts/plot_server_metrics.py results/<run>
```

Build cross-run summaries:

```bash
python analysis_scripts/plot_lambda_slowdown_goodput.py \
  --results-dir results \
  --output-dir results/aggregate_analysis/lambda_slowdown_goodput

python analysis_scripts/analyze_job_call_slowdown_by_release.py \
  --results-dir results \
  --baseline-dir results/baseline_20260424-180204 \
  --output-dir results/aggregate_analysis/job_call_slowdown_by_release_time
```

Re-aggregate summary over a steady-state window (e.g. drop the first 20 min of warmup):

```bash
python analysis_scripts/summarize_sweep_window.py \
  --run-dirs results/260510_*tau5_lambda_* \
  --window-min 20 80 \
  --output-csv results/aggregate_analysis/sweep_window_summary_tau5_20to80min.csv \
  --print-markdown \
  --plot-png results/aggregate_analysis/sweep_window_goodput_vs_lambda_tau5_20to80min.png
```

Filters: calls by `start_time`, jobs by `job_submit_time`, both relative to each run's first call. Uses the same `build_summary` as the per-run parser so columns stay in lockstep with `application_summary.csv`. `--plot-png` produces a `λ → call/job goodput rate` line plot (SLO attainment view) over the same window.

## Goodput

Baseline latencies are loaded from `--baseline-dir`.

```text
call_goodput = call_latency < baseline_call_latency * tau
job_goodput  = job_latency  < baseline_job_latency  * tau
```

Call/job cross buckets are written to:

```text
analysis/application_call_job_goodput.csv
analysis/application_call_job_goodput_summary.csv
analysis/application_job_call_goodput_summary.csv
```

For `swe_bench_coding_tool_delay`, job timing with and without simulated tool-call intervals is written separately:

```text
analysis/application_job_transition_adjusted.csv
analysis/application_job_transition_adjusted_summary.csv
```

The raw job summary `transition_time` field is the total application-side simulated tool delay for that job. The existing `application_jobs.csv` and `application_summary.csv` should remain compatible with older runs.

For `swe_bench_coding_parallel_tool_delay`, call-level performance still comes from `metrics.csv`. Parallel structure is recorded separately:

```text
parallel_calls.csv
analysis/application_parallel_calls.csv
analysis/application_parallel_rounds.csv
```

Use `execution_round`, not `wave`, for the group of calls that start after the same dependency barrier.

### Run-boundary cutoffs (unclassified jobs)

Jobs that did not complete because the run ended (`is_server_terminated=True`)
and that were not also admission-rejected or `is_job_timeout=True` have an
**unknown outcome** — they were neither verified to meet the SLO nor verified
to violate it. The parser treats these as **unclassified**:

- `parse_application_metrics.py` `add_tau_goodput()` sets `job_goodput_bool = NaN` for such jobs (run-boundary cutoff condition: `is_server_terminated & ~is_rejected & ~is_job_timeout`).
- All downstream goodput rates use `classifiable_jobs = job_goodput_bool.notna()` as the denominator, so unclassified jobs drop out instead of counting as SLO misses.
- `wasted_tokens` only sums tokens from jobs **explicitly** classified as not-goodput. Unclassified-job tokens are excluded from `wasted_compute_ratio`.
- `summarize_sweep_window.py` records `output_goodput_tokens_per_s`, `output_wasted_tokens_per_s`, and `output_unclassified_tokens_per_s` separately, and looks up the classification from the **full** jobs table (not the windowed slice) so a call whose `start_time` is in the analysis window but whose parent job's `submit_time` is just before the window still gets attributed correctly.
- The token-throughput stacked-bar plot uses **classified throughput only** (goodput + wasted) as the bar height, so the two segments sum to 100% within each bar. The unclassified bucket stays in the CSV for inspection but is omitted from the figure.

**Why excluded, not counted as a miss:** A job cut off by run end may well have been on track for goodput. Counting it as "not goodput" systematically penalizes low-λ runs (where chain duration exceeds inter-arrival, so jobs released near the run end can't finish before termination). The classified-only rate isolates real SLO behavior.

If you change the run duration or window, the unclassified count shifts accordingly; report it alongside the goodput rate when the share is non-trivial.

## Confirmation Before Reporting Results

When the user asks to **show / summarize / build / compare** experiment results
("보여줘 / 정리해줘 / 결과 만들어줘 / 비교해줘"), restate the measurement
choices before producing tables or figures, and ask for confirmation:

1. **Metric**: call goodput rate, job goodput rate, rejection rate, slowdown distribution, throughput, wasted tokens, etc.
2. **Definition**: denominator (e.g. classified jobs only vs all jobs), tau threshold, baseline source, window range (warmup / drain handling).
3. **Run scope**: which runs are in / out, baseline location.

Restate even when the user is following up on a prior measurement — call out
the inherited choices in one or two lines so the user can correct them.
Do not silently reuse defaults from earlier in the conversation if the new
ask might want different ones (e.g. switching from per-run summary to a
windowed steady-state summary).

If a metric definition has recently changed (see "Run-boundary cutoffs"
above for the current definition of `job_goodput_rate`), note that in the
restatement so the user knows which version is being used.

## Figure Styling (paper figures)

Project-wide defaults for paper-grade figures. Apply these to every new plot
intended for the paper so the whole paper looks consistent. Figure size and
inner axes box can vary per figure; the items below should stay fixed unless
explicitly relaxed.

Reference implementation: [analysis_scripts/summarize_sweep_window.py](analysis_scripts/summarize_sweep_window.py)
(`plot_goodput_vs_lambda`).

### rcParams (apply via `plt.rc_context`)

```python
PAPER_STYLE = {
    "font.family": "serif",
    "font.serif": ["DejaVu Serif", "Times New Roman", "Liberation Serif"],
    "font.size": 8,
    "axes.labelsize": 9,
    "axes.titlesize": 9,
    "axes.linewidth": 0.75,
    "legend.fontsize": 8,
    "legend.frameon": False,
    "xtick.labelsize": 8,
    "ytick.labelsize": 8,
    "xtick.direction": "in",
    "ytick.direction": "in",
    "xtick.major.size": 3.0,
    "ytick.major.size": 3.0,
    "xtick.major.width": 0.7,
    "ytick.major.width": 0.7,
    "lines.linewidth": 1.4,
    "lines.markersize": 4.5,
}
```

### Layout

- All four spines visible (full frame).
- y-axis dotted grid only: `linestyle=":"`, `linewidth=0.7`, `alpha=0.6`. No x-axis grid.
- Legend frameless, placed above the axes: `loc="lower center"`, `bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, 1.02)`, `ncol=N` (horizontal).
- Marker edge: white, 0.5 pt (helps when markers overlap).
- Save with `dpi=300`. Do **not** use `bbox_inches="tight"` when the inner axes box must hit a target physical size; pin it with `ax.set_position()` instead.
- For ACM 2-column (`acmart` `sigconf`): single-column max width is 3.33 in. If the inner axes box plus margins exceed that, let LaTeX scale via `\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]`.

### Color palette

Use matplotlib `tab10` in this order so colors stay tied to roles across figures.

| Role | Hex |
|---|---|
| Request/call-level metric (primary) | `#1f77b4` (blue) |
| Job-level metric (secondary) | `#d62728` (red) |
| Third series | `#2ca02c` (green) |
| Fourth series | `#9467bd` (purple) |

If colorblind-safe output is required for a venue, swap to the Wong palette: `#0072B2`, `#D55E00`, `#009E73`, `#CC79A7`.

### Naming

- For latency-SLO attainment **rates** (the goodput rate metrics): use **"Request-level SLO attainment"** and **"Job-level SLO attainment"** in legends and prose. y-axis label: `"SLO attainment (%)"`.
- For token-level throughput plots (stacked-area, total tokens generated in the analysis window): use **"Goodput tokens"** for the SLO-meeting portion and **"Wasted tokens"** for the rest. The stack total = throughput. y-axis label: `"Output tokens (M)"` with values in millions.
- Avoid "call goodput" / "job goodput" in legends.
- Arrival-rate x-axis label: `r"Arrival rate $\lambda$ (jobs/sec)"`. On dense log-axis ticks, rotate labels 45°, `ha="right"`, `rotation_mode="anchor"`. Invert the axis so higher load is on the left.
- For rejection rate plotted alongside goodput, use a **twin y-axis** on the right labeled `"Rejection rate (%)"`. Keep tick/label/spine colors at the default (black) — only the rejection line itself carries its color (orange dashed).

## Editing Guidance

- Keep run output schemas stable unless explicitly asked to migrate them.
- Prefer adding new analysis CSVs over mutating existing CSVs.
- Keep analysis scripts in `analysis_scripts/`.
- Keep cross-run outputs in `results/aggregate_analysis/`, not at the `results/` root.
- Check `workloads/AGENTS.md` and the nearest workload-specific `AGENTS.md` before changing workload adapters.
- Run `python -m py_compile analysis_scripts/*.py run_experiment.py` after moving or editing scripts.
- 사용자가 명확히 실행/수정/테스트를 요청하면 바로 진행한다.
- 요구사항이 애매하거나 실험 설정이 결과를 크게 바꿀 수 있으면 먼저 짧게 확인한다.
- 큰 코드 변경이 필요한 경우에는 먼저 간단한 pseudocode나 코드 스켈레톤을 보여주고 피드백을 받은 뒤 진행한다.
