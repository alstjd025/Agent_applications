"""Paper figure: EXP-53 — four control planes on one static rate sweep.

  FluidServe   our policy, gate slack 1.0, the configuration tagged v0.1.1
  PolyServe    static per-class partition, ported
  Llumnix SLO  the shipped SLO-aware policy
  Llumnix      the shipped load-balancing policy, no SLO input

Two PDFs, each two side-by-side panels — (left) SLO attainment, (right) output
token goodput — against offered request rate, sized for ONE COLUMN of a
two-column USENIX paper. They differ only in whether the offered-denominator
curves are drawn:

  exp53_attainment_goodput_offered.pdf    with the offered curves
  exp53_attainment_goodput_admitted.pdf   admitted denominator only

Sizing, and why the labelling is trimmed, are in `paper_style.py` and in
`README.md` in this directory. Include at width=\\columnwidth and do not rescale.

WHY THE OFFERED CURVES MATTER MORE HERE THAN IN ANY OTHER FIGURE WE HAVE. Two
of the four arms reject and two cannot. Read on the admitted denominator alone,
Llumnix SLO IMPROVES from 44.0% at 50 req/s to 69.8% at 70 req/s — while its
rejection rate goes from 20.7% to 68.9%. It is not getting better; it is
refusing more than two thirds of the arrivals and scoring itself on the third it
kept. On the offered denominator the same arm goes 34.7 -> 21.1. An
admitted-only version of this figure shows a rising curve for a collapsing
policy, so the admitted-only PDF should only be used where the surrounding text
gives the rejection rates.

X AXIS. The eight measured rates (15, 25, 35, 45, 50, 55, 60, 70) cannot all
carry a label in 1.3 in of axis width without colliding. Five of them are
labelled and all eight get a tick, so every label still sits on a rate that was
actually measured and the unlabelled ticks show where the other three are. The
axis stays linear, which is why 45-60 looks crowded: those four rates really are
10 req/s apart and the knee really is that narrow.
