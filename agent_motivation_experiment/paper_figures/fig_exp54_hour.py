"""Paper figure: EXP-54 — three control planes on the hour-long dynamic trace.

Two PDFs, each two side-by-side panels against time — (left) SLO attainment,
(right) output token goodput — drawn at 7.0 in, the USENIX full text width, so
they go in a `figure*` at `width=\\textwidth` with no rescaling.

  exp54_hour_offered.pdf     attainment on the offered denominator
  exp54_hour_admitted.pdf    attainment on the admitted denominator

USE THE OFFERED VERSION UNLESS THE TEXT ALREADY GIVES THE REJECTION RATES. The
three arms reject at completely different rates over this hour — FluidServe
27.0%, Llumnix SLO 42.1%, PolyServe 0.0% — so the admitted denominator flatters
them by completely different amounts and reorders them. Whole-run figures:

              rejected   offered   admitted   goodput tok/s
  FluidServe     27.0%      70.0       95.9          18,014
  Llumnix SLO    42.1%      38.7       67.0          11,451
  PolyServe       0.0%      13.9       13.9           3,198

PolyServe's two attainment numbers are the same because it never rejects; the
other two gain 26 and 28 points from having refused work.

PolyServe's 13.9 disagrees with the 17.6 in the EXP-54 write-up's headline
table. 13.9 is what the runs give and it is what that write-up's OWN per-class
table implies: 3.7 / 8.8 / 95.3 on chat / deep research / agent, over 140,304 /
21,161 / 17,978 requests, weights out to 13.9. Every other cell of that table
reproduces here, including PolyServe's goodput (3,198) and throughput (18,150)
exactly, so the disagreement is one value in that document rather than a
difference in window or scoring. Resolve it there before quoting either.

The goodput panel is the guard against all of this: rejected work produces no
tokens, so no denominator choice can inflate it.

WHAT THE HOUR IS. `dyn60_short_m123`, mean offered 50.1 req/s, about 179,000
requests. Arrival rate follows an Azure production trace; the class mix steps
m1 -> m2 -> m3 -> m1 at 15-minute boundaries, marked with grey guides. The
guides are NOT labelled on the figure, so the caption has to say what they are.

THE LOAD-BALANCE ARM IS ABSENT, AND NOT BECAUSE IT LOST. `exp54r1_loadbalance`
was stopped at 87% of its tasks: it rejects nothing, so from minute 40 all four
engines saturated, queued requests had their streams cut, and the client began
failing to obtain source ports — 62,114 `[Errno 99] Cannot assign requested
address`, against zero in every other arm. Its last twenty minutes measure the
load generator, not the policy. Reporting it as a fourth curve would be
reporting a client defect as a result. Say it is excluded and why.

RUN-BOUNDARY CUTOFFS, AND WHY THE X AXIS STOPS SHORT OF 60 MINUTES. A request
still in flight when the run ends has an unknown outcome, so `attain()` removes
it from both denominators rather than counting it as a violation. That rule is
right in general and wrong at the end of a backlogged run: the requests still in
flight there are precisely the slow ones, so removing them removes the failures.
PolyServe's final window has 3,678 arrivals of which 3,396 — 92.3% — never
finished, leaving 282 fast ones and an attainment of 99.6% against 9.1% two
minutes earlier. Nothing recovered; the population changed.

Windows in which more than MAX_CUTOFF of arrivals were still in flight are
therefore dropped, and all arms are cut at the same time so the panels stay
comparable. FluidServe never exceeds 4.5% and Llumnix SLO 5.8%, because both
reject and neither builds a backlog; PolyServe reaches 92.3%. The trim is
reported when the script runs.

ONE RUN PER ARM. Repeat 2 was still running when this was drawn and covers only
FluidServe, so no arm here has a repeat and no feature on any line is
noise-bounded. Do not add repeat 2's FluidServe alone: an arm with a band beside
two arms without one reads as the better-measured arm rather than the only
repeated one.
