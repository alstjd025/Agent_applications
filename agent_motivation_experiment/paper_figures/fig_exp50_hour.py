"""Paper figure: the hour — FluidServe against Llumnix SLO on a moving load.

One PDF, two side-by-side panels against time: (left) SLO attainment on the
ADMITTED denominator, (right) output token goodput. Drawn at 7.0 in, the USENIX
full text width, so it goes in a `figure*` at `width=\\textwidth` with no
rescaling. See `paper_style.py` and `README.md` in this directory.

  exp50_hour_attainment_goodput.pdf

This is panels D and G of `results/aggregate_analysis/exp50/hour_timeline.png`
reduced to the two arms that are being compared, drawn at paper size. The
windowing and both metrics are taken from
`analysis_scripts/request_level/exp41_dynamic_timeline.py` rather than
reimplemented: a 90 s window stepped every 30 s, anchored on ARRIVAL, so a point
at minute t reads "of the requests that arrived around t, this is what happened
to them". A request arriving at t and finishing at t+30 s is scored at t. A
window holding fewer than 30 requests is dropped rather than plotted as a noisy
point.

THE ADMITTED DENOMINATOR IS THE ONE ASKED FOR, AND IT IS THE FLATTERING ONE FOR
BOTH ARMS. Rejections leave the population entirely, so this panel is "how well
was the work the policy chose to do actually done", not "what fraction of the
offered load was served". Both arms reject heavily on this trace and neither
rejection rate is on the figure, so THE CAPTION HAS TO GIVE THEM; the whole-hour
figures are in README.md. The goodput panel is the partial guard, because
rejected work produces no tokens and so cannot inflate it.

TWO ARMS, ONE RUN EACH, FROM DIFFERENT SESSIONS. Nothing here has a repeat, so
no band on either line is a confidence interval — every wiggle is one
realisation. The two runs are also from different experiments a day apart. Both
saw the same trace, which panel A of the source figure verifies by drawing the
offered rate per arm and finding one curve.
