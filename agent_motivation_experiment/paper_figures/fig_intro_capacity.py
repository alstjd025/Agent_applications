"""Paper figure (intro): the load these four engines sustain is set by the router.

  intro_capacity.pdf        3.335 x 1.85 in, one column, the bars alone
  intro_capacity_curves.pdf 3.335 x 2.20 in, the same claim with its derivation
  intro_capacity_pair.pdf   3.335 x 1.75 in, both of the above side by side

**The claim.** Capacity is defined here as the highest offered rate at which at
least 90% of ARRIVING requests still meet their own latency rule -- rejections
counted as misses, so a policy cannot buy the number by refusing work. On the
same four engines, the same request mix and the same rule:

      FluidServe v0.2   28.4 req/s
      vLLM router       21.6
      Llumnix SLO       20.4
      llm-d             20.3
      PolyServe         15.9

Recomputed 2026-08-21 on the pinned clean set (EXP-82 + EXP-86, two repeats at
every one of the eight rates for all five arms). The previous table in this
docstring -- 28.1 / 21.4 / 20.4 / 18.7 / 15.8 -- came from the six-experiment
mixture that preceded the GOMAXPROCS instrumentation fix and MUST NOT be quoted.

**Why two files.** The bar chart is the compact statement. The curve version
shows where each bar comes from: attainment against offered rate with a rule at
90% and the crossings dropped to the axis. For an introduction the curves are
usually the better figure, because a reader who has not yet been told what
"capacity" means here can see it being measured; the bars are for when space is
short or the same quantity has already been introduced.

**How the number is computed.** Linear interpolation between the two measured
conditions that bracket 90%, which is the definition motivation_fig3.py uses so
the two agree. Eight rates per arm: 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 45, 55, 70 req/s.

**Robustness, and the part of it that does NOT hold.**

      counted as saturated  vLLM router  PolyServe  Llumnix SLO  llm-d  FluidServe
             95%              20.7        15.4         19.7      10.0      25.7
             90%              21.6        15.9         20.4      20.3      28.4
             80%              23.4        16.7         21.2      22.5      33.9
             70%              25.1        17.6         22.0      24.7      40.3

FluidServe is first at every threshold, so "this policy sustains the highest
rate" does not depend on where the line is drawn, and the margin over the second
arm grows as the threshold falls: 1.24x at 95%, 1.31x at 90%, 1.45x at 80%,
1.61x at 70%. **The ordering among the four baselines depends on the threshold.**
llm-d is LAST at 95% (10.0 req/s, and that value is set by a rate whose two
repeats disagree by 11.5 points), fourth at 90% by 0.1 req/s against Llumnix SLO,
and second at 80% and 70%, because it degrades gradually while the other two fall
off a cliff. A single capacity number therefore ranks our policy against the
baselines robustly and ranks the baselines against each other only at the
threshold it was computed for. Say so in the caption; the curve figure shows
it directly and is the better choice where the ranking of baselines matters.

**CAVEATS that belong in the caption.**

1. **Which vLLM router.** The fifth arm is the PyPI `vllm-router` package's
   default `cache_aware` policy, a fork of the SGLang model gateway -- NOT
   vllm-project/production-stack, whose Helm default is `roundrobin`. Two
   different pieces of software carry the name, so the caption has to name this
   one. All five arms are on the post-2026-08-08 workload.
2. **Repeats are uneven, and four of the five crossings sit in the thin part.**
   The vLLM router has **two repeats at every rate** (EXP-77, complete
   2026-08-11); FluidServe and llm-d have two at 35-70 req/s and one at 10-25
   (EXP-68/69/70); PolyServe and Llumnix SLO have **one at every rate**
   (EXP-72). Only the vLLM router's crossing falls in a two-repeat region.
3. **The vLLM router's crossing is interpolated over a narrower gap than ours.**
   21.4 sits between measured 20 (99.1%) and 25 (66.6%), a 5 req/s bracket; 28.1
   sits between 25 (95.7%) and 35 (77.6%), a 10 req/s bracket. Quote the bracket
   with the number.
4. **Two arms have no admission control and lose requests another way.**
   PolyServe and the vLLM router reject nothing, but 21.8-61.6% (vLLM router) and
   34.7-37.9% (PolyServe) of arrivals are still unfinished when the window closes
   above 25 req/s and leave both denominators. Counting every unfinished request
   as a violation moves the vLLM router from 7.8/3.7/2.5 to 6.1/2.3/1.0 at
   35/45/70 req/s and does not change the ordering.
5. **swe is scored from a different workload config for llm-d and Llumnix SLO**
   (m1f, 2,500 ms / 52 ms per token) than for the other three (m1 with a
   25:e2e:30000 override), because neither can express an end-to-end budget. All
   five are judged against the same 30 s end-to-end rule when scored.
6. **No prediction line.** The dashed additive prediction in
   motivation_capacity_is_a_policy.png comes from EXP-55, which ran each class
   alone on the pre-fix workload. Drawing it here would put a pre-fix line
   against post-fix bars. Re-measuring EXP-55 is what brings it back.

# THE ORDER OF THIS LIST IS THE ORDER OF THE LEGEND AND OF THE BARS, and it is
# fixed by convention across the paper: vLLM, PolyServe, Llumnix SLO, llm-d,
# FluidServe, ours last. It is NOT sorted by capacity, so the bar panel no
# longer rises left to right; the value printed over each bar is what carries
# the ranking. The consistent order is worth more than the monotone one --
# a reader who has learned the legend on one figure reads every other figure
# without relearning it, and in the paired figure the bars carry no names of
# their own and are identified only by their position in that order.
# An arm with no post-fix runs yet is skipped with a message rather than silently
# dropped, and rather than being filled in from its pre-fix sweep -- EXP-53/57
# and EXP-66 are a different workload and putting them on this axis is the
# same-name-two-quantities failure this repository keeps hitting.
# ⚠ THE RUNS CHANGED ON 2026-08-18. Every arm now comes from ONE OF TWO
# EXPERIMENTS, EXP-82 and EXP-86, rather than from the six-experiment mixture
# (EXP-68/69/70/72/77/80) that fed this table until then. Those earlier runs are
# not wrong, but they were taken while the Llumnix Go gateway was being stopped
# by the kernel: it sized its thread pool from the host's 72 CPUs against a
# container quota of 8 cores, so it was descheduled for 18.7% of the run and
# every stream it carried froze and thawed together. EXP-82 (FluidServe, llm-d)
# and EXP-86 (the other three) re-measured all eight rates with two repeats at
# `GOMAXPROCS=16`; the fraction of token intervals under 5 ms falls from 14.11%
# to 0.29%. The pinned set is `paper_experiment/static_sweep_clean_2026-08/`
# and the superseded figures are in `paper_figures/old_2026-08-18/`.
#
# ⚠ AND IT WAS NOT ONLY THE INSTRUMENTATION, at least for our arm. EXP-82 wrote
# down in advance that a gateway which stops for 18.7% of the run might be
# holding FluidServe back through its own hold-and-retry path, and that if
# attainment moved the experiment had fixed the SYSTEM rather than the
# measurement. At 45 / 55 / 70 req/s FluidServe rejects 2.4-2.8 points less and
# attains 3.2-3.7 points more, and the two-repeat intervals of the old and new
# runs do not overlap at any of the three. THE CAPTION MUST NOT SAY THE NUMBERS
# ARE UNCHANGED. The knee moves very little (28.0 -> 28.4) because it is set at
# 25-35 req/s, where the shift is +0.9 and +0.3.
