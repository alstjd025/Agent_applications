"""Paper figure: four deployed routers, comparable tokens produced, 15x apart in
the ones that count.

  motivation_throughput_vs_goodput.pdf   7.0 x 1.62 in, `figure*`, width=\\textwidth

  (a) output tokens per second the engines produced
  (b) how much of that belonged to a request that finished inside its rule
  (c) the same question counted in REQUESTS, on both denominators

FLUIDSERVE IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. A motivation figure that needs the paper's
own system to make its point is not a motivation figure. The four arms here are
all deployed or published systems: the static class partition (PolyServe), the
two SLO-aware control planes (Llumnix SLO, llm-d) and the vLLM router's default
cache-aware policy.

(a) AND (b) SHARE A Y AXIS ON PURPOSE. The claim is that the first is nearly the
same across policies and the second is not; rescaling either would hide it. At
70 req/s the four produce 9,534 / 8,025 / 9,968 / 13,436 output tokens per second
-- a spread of 1.7x -- and turn 479 / 7,347 / 843 / 600 of them into requests
that met their rule, a spread of 15.3x. The vLLM router is the sharpest case on
its own: it produces the MOST tokens of the four and converts 4.5% of them.

(c) IS NOT A RESTATEMENT OF (b). (b) weights each request by the tokens it
produced, so a policy that keeps long requests and refuses short ones scores well
on it; (c) counts each request once.

(c) therefore carries both denominators: solid counts every request that arrived,
so a rejection is a violation; dotted counts only the requests the policy
accepted. Only Llumnix SLO and llm-d reject, so only their accepted lines are
drawn -- PolyServe and the vLLM router have no admission control at all and their
two lines would coincide exactly, which would assert a distinction the data does
not contain. llm-d's dotted line stays between 88.8 and 92.1% from 35 to 70 req/s
while its solid line falls from 42.9 to 17.7; the whole distance between them is
its rejection rate, which reaches 80.4%.

⚠ THE TWO ARMS THAT NEVER REJECT PRODUCE A DIFFERENT KIND OF MISSING REQUEST,
AND IT IS NOT ON THE FIGURE. A policy with no admission control does not refuse a
request; it leaves it unfinished when the measurement window closes. Those
requests have no outcome, so `attain()` drops them from BOTH denominators, and in
a backlogged arm they are the slow ones. At 35 / 45 / 70 req/s that share is
21.8 / 39.6 / 61.6% for the vLLM router and 37.9 / 35.9 / 35.7% for PolyServe,
against 1.0 / 0.5 / 0.3% for llm-d and 3.8 / 2.5 / 2.2% for Llumnix SLO. The
exclusion therefore favours the two arms that reject nothing. Counting every
unfinished request as a violation puts the vLLM router at 6.1 / 2.3 / 1.0 instead
of 7.8 / 3.7 / 2.5; the ordering does not change, and the caption has to say so.

DATA. The static rate sweep on the workload as fixed on 2026-08-08, eight rates
(10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 45, 55, 70 req/s), 8 minutes per condition, four engines.
The run selection is `analysis_scripts/redraw_static_sweep_workload2026-08-08.sh`
and the provenance is
`results/aggregate_analysis/static_sweep_workload2026-08-08/README.md`.

  PolyServe, Llumnix SLO   EXP-72, one repeat at every rate
  llm-d                    EXP-68/70, two repeats at 35-70 and one at 10-25
  vLLM router              EXP-77, one repeat at every rate; repeat 2 had not
                           finished when this was drawn

No error bars are drawn and no point here is noise-bounded. Session-to-session
movement on this workload has been measured at up to 4.6 points, which is far
below the differences the figure is read for but not below every comparison in
it; the README names the ones to be careful with.

⚠ NOT COMPARABLE WITH ANY EARLIER VERSION OF THIS FIGURE. Until 2026-08-10 it was
drawn from EXP-53/57, which predate the load-generator fix of 2026-08-08: a
per-worker dataset split never ran on mixed workloads, so twelve workers sent the
same prompt sequence and engine prefix cache hit rate was inflated from 28.9% to
83-86%. The arms changed too -- that version had Llumnix's load-balancing policy,
which this sweep does not include, and did not have the vLLM router.

swe is configured two ways and scored one way: llm-d and Llumnix SLO cannot
express an end-to-end budget and take the `m1f` workload configuration, PolyServe
and the vLLM router take `m1`, and all four are judged against the same 30 s
end-to-end rule.
