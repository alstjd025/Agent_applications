# The EXP-54 hour-trace figure set, drawn for EXP-71's two arms.
#
# Why a second script rather than an argument to redraw_hour_trace.sh. That one
# defines the canonical hour comparison -- the three Llumnix-side control planes
# on the 25-75 req/s trace -- and its output directory is cited by motivation.md.
# EXP-71 is a different trace (10-45 req/s, rebanded because EXP-70 put the knee
# at 28.1 req/s and 93% of the old band sat above it), a different workload (the
# per-worker prompt duplication was removed on 2026-08-08), and a different pair
# of arms. Putting them on the same figures would place four incomparable things
# on one axis.
#
#   FluidServe v0.2   arm `fspfx`, variant `fullb`
#   llm-d             arm `llmdslo`, variant `full`
#
# The two variant names differ because the arms come from different drivers:
# run_exp30_dynamic.sh names its variant and run_exp68_llmd.sh takes the session
# whole. Every script below is therefore given explicit directories, except
# exp41_engine_view.py which globs, and there the pattern carries a trailing
# wildcard so `_full` matches `_fullb` too.
#
# llm-d does not go through the Llumnix scheduler, so its engine attribution
# comes from Envoy's upstream-host field and has to be built before the engine
# figures can see it. That is the first step here rather than an assumption.
#
#   bash analysis_scripts/redraw_hour_trace_exp71.sh [out-dir] [pass]
#     pass: "" for the first (exp71r1), "b" for the second (exp71br1)
