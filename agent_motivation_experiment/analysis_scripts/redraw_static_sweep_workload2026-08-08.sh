# The standard rate-sweep figure set for the FIVE control planes on the workload
# as it has stood since the 2026-08-08 load-generator fix.
#
# It was four until 2026-08-10, when EXP-77 added the vLLM router's default
# cache_aware policy. The four existing curves are unchanged by that; nothing in
# their globs moved.
#
# The name carries the date rather than saying "post-fix", because this project
# has two boundaries -- the 2026-08-08 workload fix and the 2026-08-09 hour-trace
# band change -- and "post-fix" does not say which. It also does not carry an
# experiment number, which is the convention for everything else under
# results/aggregate_analysis/, because the four arms come from four experiments:
# EXP-68/69/70 for FluidServe v0.2 and llm-d, EXP-72 for the other two. Calling
# it exp72 would put that number on two arms it did not measure.
#
# Why a fourth redraw script. redraw_static_sweep.sh draws the canonical
# comparison from EXP-53/57 and redraw_static_sweep_llmd.sh adds llm-d to it;
# both are on the workload from BEFORE the load-generator fix, where twelve
# workers sent identical prompt streams and the engines' prefix cache hit rate
# was inflated from 28.9% to 83-86%. Those figures are cited as they are. This
# one draws only post-fix runs, and writes to its own directory so neither of
# the others changes under a document that already quotes it.
#
# The arm globs are written out one arm at a time rather than widened, because
# the pre-fix sweeps are still on disk (84 conditions under exp53/54/57) and a
# looser pattern averages them in without saying so. That has happened here
# before: EXP-53's PolyServe was superseded by EXP-57 and anything still
# globbing exp53 averaged 27.5 and 35.6 into 31.6 and drew a policy that never
# ran. The condition count behind every glob is printed before anything is drawn.
#
#   FluidServe v0.2  fspfx     EXP-68s/68r/69 (35-70, two repeats) + EXP-70 (10-25, one)
#   llm-d            llmdslo   EXP-68s/68r    (35-70, two repeats) + EXP-70 (10-25, one)
#   Llumnix SLO      slo       EXP-72 (all eight rates, ONE repeat)
#   PolyServe        polyserve EXP-72 (all eight rates, ONE repeat)
#   vLLM router      vllmcache EXP-77 (all eight rates; repeat 2 was still running
#                               when this arm was first drawn -- re-run this script
#                               once EXP-77 finishes and the second repeat lands)
#
# EXP-73's fspfx conditions at 25, 35 and 45 are deliberately NOT in the
# FluidServe glob. They are the control arm of an ablation ladder and are the
# same configuration, so they are legitimate repeats -- but including them would
# give one arm four repeats at three rates while every other arm has one or two,
# and the figure would then be drawn from a different number of runs per point
# per arm with nothing on the image saying so.
#
# Two things that have to be said next to these figures rather than discovered:
#
#   Every rate below 35 req/s is one repeat for all four arms, and EXP-72 is one
#   repeat throughout. All four knees fall in single-repeat territory, so a point
#   with no error bar is not a precise point -- it is an unrepeated one.
#
#   Llumnix SLO and llm-d take the m1f workload config, the other two take m1.
#   Neither of those policies can express an end-to-end budget, so left on m1
#   they read the agent class's 25 ms tier key as a per-token target and reject
#   almost all of it. Scoring is unaffected: that class is judged end-to-end at
#   30 s whatever the config says.

# The title and the note are in English because the serif font these figures are
# drawn in carries no Hangul, so Korean text renders as empty boxes. matplotlib
# says so as a UserWarning and still writes the file.
# Kept to two lines. A note long enough to wrap six times pushes the axes into
# the lower two thirds of the canvas, and the detail belongs in the experiment
# file rather than on the image. THIS HAPPENED AGAIN on 2026-08-10, when the
# fifth arm was added and the note grew to eleven lines: it covered the legend
# and pushed the axes below the midline. Anything longer than the two lines
# below goes in README.md in the output directory, which is where a reader who
# needs the provenance will look anyway.
NOTE="A point with no error bar is ONE run, not a precise one, and all five crossings of the 90% rule fall in that region. Llumnix SLO and llm-d take the m1f config; the agent class is scored end-to-end at 30 s either way. Provenance per arm and per rate: README.md beside this figure."
