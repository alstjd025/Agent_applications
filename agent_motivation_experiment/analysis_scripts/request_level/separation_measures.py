"""How separated are the classes, measured four ways, for any set of runs.

The motivation section needs to say that fully separating the classes is bad,
fully mixing them is bad, and the good region is in between. Saying that needs a
number for "how separated", and the one used so far -- the share of a class held
by the instance holding the most of it -- has two problems that this script
exists to fix.

  1. It does not read as what it means when a system dedicates SEVERAL instances
     to one class. The static-partition baseline gives two of four instances to
     the software-engineering class, and that class then reads 50%, which is the
     same number an unpartitioned system would produce by holding half of a class
     on one instance by chance.

  2. It measures how spread a CLASS is. The mechanism that makes separation
     worth anything is the other direction: an instance holding one request of
     the tightest-budget class is held to that budget for everything else it
     might take. What matters is therefore a property of the INSTANCE.

So four quantities are produced per run. All of them are computed on the same
windows and the same attribution, so they can be read against each other.

  top1        the share of a class held by the instance holding the most of it,
              median over windows. 25% for an even spread over four instances,
              100% for one instance. This is what earlier documents call the
              class concentration and it is kept so that new numbers can be
              checked against recorded ones.

  eff_inst    the effective number of instances a class runs on, 1 / sum(p_i^2)
              where p_i is instance i's share of the class. 4.0 for an even
              spread over four instances, 1.0 for one instance, 2.0 for two
              instances holding half each. This is the quantity that reads
              correctly for a system dedicating two instances to one class.

  eff_class   the effective number of classes an instance holds, 1 / sum(q_c^2)
              where q_c is class c's share of the instance's requests. Averaged
              over instances. Its maximum is not 3.0 but the effective number of
              classes in the workload mixture, because a class that is 8% of
              arrivals cannot occupy a third of every instance; that ceiling is
              printed alongside so the reading has a scale.

  nochat      the fraction of (instance, sample time) pairs at which an instance
              held no resident request of the tightest-budget class. This is the
              mechanism variable: an instance in that state is admissible to
              classes promised a looser pace, and an instance not in that state
              is not. 0% means every instance always held one.

`nochat` is derived from the client's records -- a request is treated as
resident on its instance from when it started to when it ended -- rather than
from the scheduler's gate gauge, for one reason: the gauge exists only in our
own policy, so the gauge cannot compare us against the baselines. The two
instruments are independent and both are available for our own runs, so the
script prints the gauge value too when it can find it and the difference between
them is a check on the derivation.

    0.5 * sum_i |p_i(t) - p_i(t-1)|. It reads 0 when the class is distributed
    the same way it was and 1 when it has moved entirely to instances it was not
    on before.

    This is the second axis, and it is independent of the first. A static
    partition reads near zero because the assignment is a configuration. Load
    balancing also reads near zero, because the distribution is uniform in every
    window and uniform does not move. What distinguishes them is the first axis,
    the number of instances a class runs on. A system that produces its
    separation per request reads above zero on this axis while reading below
    four on the first, and that combination is what neither baseline produces.

    Normalising per class is what makes this a property of the ASSIGNMENT rather
    than of the workload. The first version of this function measured the change
    in each instance's class composition instead, and on the one-hour trace the
    load-equalising baseline read highest of all (0.103 against the static

    three times in that trace. Dividing by the class total removes that.
