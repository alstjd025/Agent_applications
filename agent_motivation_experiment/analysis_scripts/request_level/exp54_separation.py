"""Does the class separation reproduce, and does the score depend on it?

EXP-54 recorded a clean separation in repeat 1 -- deep research collected on one
engine -- and section 58.3 read that as the mechanism producing the score.

The first version of this script answered the question with a whole-run
statistic and got it wrong. Pooled over the hour, the share of deep research on
the engine holding the most of it read 58.7% in repeat 1 and 32.6% in repeat 2
against 25% for an even spread, which was recorded as "the separation does not
reproduce". Windowed at three minutes both repeats sit at 99-100% for the first
third of the hour: the separation reproduces, and what differs is WHICH engine
holds it and whether that lasts. Repeat 1 keeps deep research on engine 8001 for
the whole hour; repeat 2 moves it from 8002 to 8003 to 8001. Summing an hour
over a target whose identity moves spreads the distribution and reads as no
concentration at all.

So the figure carries three panels, because any two of them mislead:

  A  attainment over time, both repeats of every arm -- the score reproduces
  B  the share of each class held by the engine holding the most, windowed --
     so does the separation
  C  which engine that is -- and that does not

A class spread evenly over four engines reads 25% in B. PolyServe reads 100% for
deep research because its partition assigns that class to one engine outright.
