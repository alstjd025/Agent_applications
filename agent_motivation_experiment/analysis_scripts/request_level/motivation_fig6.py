"""Motivation figure 6: the two conditions on one quantity.

WHAT IT ARGUES. "Fully separating the classes is bad, fully mixing them is bad,
and the good region is in between" is vague until the axis is named and the two
ends are given reasons. The axis is the effective number of instances a class
runs on, 1/sum(share^2) over a 60-second window, median over windows: 4.0 for an
even spread over four instances, 1.0 for one instance, 2.0 for two. On that axis
there are two conditions, and each established method violates one.

  BELOW  a class must run on at least as many instances as its share of the work
         needs. Panel A: the static partition gives chat, whose output tokens
         amount to 2.50 instances' worth, an effective 1.02.

  ABOVE  the tightest-budget class must not be resident on every instance, or
         every instance is held to its budget. Panel B: under every fully mixed
         configuration an instance is free of chat about 1% of the time.

  AND    separation is not itself the objective. Panel B also shows the static
         partition satisfying the upper condition far better than we do and
         still scoring less than half. Panel C puts the score against the axis
         directly and shows the turn.

WHAT IT DOES NOT SAY. Panel C is not a curve. The three fully mixed
configurations land on top of each other on the axis, at an effective 3.9 to 4.0
instances, and score 87, 52 and 32; so the axis is where the two conditions live
and not a predictor of the score by itself. Panel C mixes systems. Three of its clusters are different
control planes that differ in more than this axis -- demand estimation, spill
between tiers, admission rule -- so the shape of the curve across clusters is
not a causal statement about the axis. The only within-system comparison is
FluidServe against FluidServe with the class preference off (and, once EXP-58
and EXP-59 land, the weight sweep and the pinned arms, which are drawn in the
same colour family for that reason).

  python3 motivation_fig6.py <measures.csv> [--out DIR]

The CSV is what separation_measures.py writes; it carries the score in the same
row as the measures, so no join is needed.
