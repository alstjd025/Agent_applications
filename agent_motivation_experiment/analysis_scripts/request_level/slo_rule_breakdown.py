"""Which SLO rule each class breaks, reported separately rather than combined.

An attainment figure answers "how often did this class meet its rule" and stops
there. Two classes of failure with completely different causes collapse into the
same number: a request whose tokens come out too slowly, and a request whose
first token never arrives. They call for opposite responses -- the first means
too much work is on the instance, the second means the request could not get to
an instance at all -- so combining them hides the one piece of information that
would tell them apart.

Reading them apart is what found the defect this script exists for. FluidServe
was meeting its time-between-tokens budget with room to spare (20 ms against 50)
and failing on time to first token at a median of 20 s against 5 s. No routing
explanation fits that shape: routing decides which instance serves a request and
therefore how fast its tokens come out, not whether it reaches one. The cause
was upstream of the scheduler entirely -- the gateway's worker pool.

Reports, per class: the share meeting each rule of its own SLO, the distribution
of each quantity, and how the time to first token moves over the run. A figure
that grows through a run is a backlog somewhere; a flat one is not.
