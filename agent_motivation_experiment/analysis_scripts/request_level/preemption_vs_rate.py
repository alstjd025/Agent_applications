"""Preemptions against arrival rate for the five control planes, with the panel
that stops the top one from being misread.

  preemption_vs_rate.png

WHY TWO PANELS. A preemption count on its own cannot be ranked, because zero
happens for two opposite reasons and the figure would invite the wrong one:

  llm-d          zero at every rate because it refuses 72-80% of arrivals and
                 leaves KV at 24-36%. The engines are short of work; there is
                 nothing to evict. Its token throughput is the lowest of the five.
  FluidServe     zero up to 25 req/s because what it placed fits. Its throughput
                 is the highest of the five.

So the lower panel carries KV occupancy, which separates starved from healthy
from thrashing, and the two panels have to be read together.

WHAT A PREEMPTION COSTS. vLLM V1 preempts by recompute: the prefill already done
for that request is discarded and paid for again when it is rescheduled. That
engine time produces no tokens, and no request-level metric attributes it to
anything, which is why it belongs on a figure of its own.

PolyServe FALLS from 3,175 at 35 req/s to 1,902 at 70, and that is not an
improvement. What was measured on its bottleneck engine, which is the chat engine
at every rate (100% chat at 25, 99% at 70 -- only the engine index moves, the
class does not):

  req/s   batch mean   batch max   KV mean   preemptions   waiting queue mean
     25          551         879       68%         2,137                  456
     35          554         941       68%         2,570                1,966
     45          552       1,024       59%         1,843                2,918
     55          508       1,024       52%         1,563                3,685
     70          464       1,024       40%           940                4,492

From 45 req/s the batch is pinned at exactly 1,024, which is the engine's cap on
concurrent sequences; at 25 and 35 it peaks below that at 879 and 941. Over the
same range the engine's KV occupancy FALLS, 68% down to 40%, while its queue
grows to 4,492. A preemption in vLLM V1 fires when KV runs out, so an engine
whose KV is no longer the binding constraint has less reason to evict anything,
and the count drops even as the run gets worse.

WHAT IS NOT ESTABLISHED: why the mean KV falls. Two explanations fit these
gauges and they cannot be separated with them -- the sequence cap binding before
the KV limit, so the engine stops filling KV; or step time going into prefill of
the queue, leaving fewer sequences resident per step. Telling them apart needs
the per-step decomposition of EXP-16, not these counters.

Counts are per 8-minute condition, summed over the four engines, taken as the
difference between the last and first sample of `vllm:num_preemptions_total` in
each engine's own metrics file. Error bars are min..max over repeats; a point
with no bar is one run.
