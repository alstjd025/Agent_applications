"""What the decision predicted a placement's first token would cost, against
what it actually cost -- per request, from the run's own files.

WHY THIS IS NOT A SCHEDULER COUNTER. The scheduler cannot observe the quantity
it predicts. `reconcile` marks a request as having started producing tokens
when the engine's GLOBAL step counter passes `stepAtDispatch + prefillSteps`,
which is a modelled step count rather than an observation of that request, so a
request queued behind fifteen seconds of other work is recorded as having
started within a second. Measured on the EXP-101 control condition, the
scheduler's implied placement-to-first-token time is 314 ms of mean with ZERO
placements over ten seconds, while the truth below is 0.90 s of median and
16.20 s of p90 on deep research with 22.8% over its ten-second budget.

WHAT THIS JOINS. Three files every run already writes:

  server_metrics/scheduler_dispatch.log   the generic dispatch line gives the
      wall-clock instant of the placement; the FluidServe placement line added
      for EXP-101 gives what the decision predicted, the class, and how long the
      request had already waited.
  request_ids.jsonl                       maps that uuid to (task_id,
      call_index) and to the client's send time.
  metrics.csv                             gives the client's first-token
      latency for that request.

  post-dispatch first token = first_token_latency - (dispatch - send)

Rejected, errored, timed-out and run-boundary-truncated requests are dropped,
because a truncated first-token latency is a lower bound rather than a
measurement.

WHAT IT REPORTS. Per class: the two halves of the first-token time, and then
the two-by-two table of (the decision expected this to be slow) against (it was
slow) at the class's own first-token budget. The second column of that table is
what decides whether a first-token admission test can work at all: a test can
only refuse what it can see, and if the estimate is not large where the wait is
long then no threshold on it separates the two populations, whatever constant
it is given.
