"""Three policies side by side at one offered rate, engine layer.

`plot_ratesweep_split.py` draws six panels for ONE condition, which is the right
shape for reading a single run in detail and the wrong shape for the question
this experiment asks, which is what three policies do differently with the same
four engines. This puts one policy per column and one quantity per row, on
shared y axes, so a difference between columns is a difference between policies
and not between scales.

Four rows, chosen because each answers something the request-level table cannot:

  running batch   whether the fleet is being used evenly. PolyServe's tier
                  partition shows up here directly: at 60 req/s two of its
                  engines carry about 1,000 and 700 requests while the other two
                  carry about 20.
  engine queue    work the engine has accepted but not started. A policy with no
                  admission control puts its backlog here, where it costs the
                  requests already running; a policy that holds at the gateway
                  does not.
  KV occupancy    how close each engine is to the memory bound, which is what
                  triggers preemption and recompute.
  decode tok/s    the fleet's actual output rate, summed. Attainment says how
                  many requests met their rule; this says how much work the
                  fleet did to get there.

Prefix hit rate and queueing time are deliberately left to the per-condition
figure: they are per engine and would need a fifth and sixth row that duplicate
what the first two already show, at a third of the height.
