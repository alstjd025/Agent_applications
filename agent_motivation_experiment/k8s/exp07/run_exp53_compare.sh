#                                                    saturates before spending

#
# Two things changed from EXP-25 and both are in the workload, not the policy:
#
#   swe input   22,474 -> 6,812 mean tokens (shortened transcript). At the old
#               length swe carried 82.6% of the fleet's input tokens at equal
#               request counts and cost 15x a chat request, so PolyServe's
#               partition came out (2 swe / 1 chat / 1 dr) for every mix it
#               could be given. A partition that never moves cannot be shown to
#               be worse than one that moves.
#   the mix     stated as a share of INPUT TOKENS rather than of request counts.
#               m1 balanced 31/37/31, m2 chat-heavy 64/19/16, m3 swe-heavy
#               19/19/63 (chat / deep research / swe).
#
# Reproduced off-line against allocateServers, the three mixes no longer agree:
# m2 computes (1 swe / 2 chat / 1 dr) where m1 and m3 compute (2 / 1 / 1).
#
# The scheduler policy is the only thing that differs between arms. Same
# workload, same rates, same cold engine restart per condition.
