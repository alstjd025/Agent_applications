# EXP-107 SNAPSHOT of run_exp105_swebudget.sh, taken 2026-08-27. Three arms
# added -- `fsv3cap`, `fsv3nofrc`, `fsv3capnofrc` -- and the new environment
# variables added to set_arm's clearing list. The control is EXP-104's fsv3
# runs already on disk (swe budget stays at 30 s: FS_SWE_E2E_MS unset here and
# FS_SWE_E2E_S unset in the analysis).
#
#   fsv3cap       v0.3 + the class-instance cap: per class, the number of
#                 instances whose pace gate the class sets is bounded by a
#                 demand-derived limit, and at the limit the class is placed
#                 only on its most-loaded gate holders so the surplus holders
#                 drain within one residence time.
#   fsv3nofrc     v0.3 + the force branch off: a request no instance can take
#                 within the protections, and that can no longer wait, is
#                 rejected explicitly (shed reason no_feasible) instead of
#                 being placed onto the least-damaging instance anyway.
#   fsv3capnofrc  both.
#
# ⚠ The three arms pin FS_INSTANCE_CAP / FS_FORCE / FS_CAP_WINDOW_MULT
# explicitly, and ONLY these arms do: the flags exist only in the EXP-107
# binary, and pinning them into an arm that might run on an older binary is
# the EXP-48/49 CrashLoopBackOff trap (pflag exits on an unknown flag).
#
# EXP-105 SNAPSHOT of run_exp104_v03affinity.sh, taken 2026-08-27. Two arms
# added, `fsv3b40` and `fsv3noaffb40`: v0.3 with the class preference on and off,
# with swe's end-to-end budget raised from 30 to 40 seconds.
#
# ⚠ THE ARM NAMES CARRY THE BUDGET ON PURPOSE. A results directory named `fsv3`
# would not say which budget scored it, and a run scored at 40 s cannot be
# compared with one scored at 30 s on any swe number. The budget has to move in
# TWO places at once -- the policy's --fluidserve-class-budgets, set here through
# FS_SWE_E2E_MS, and the scorer's SLO_RULES, set through FS_SWE_E2E_S -- and if
# only one moves, the scheduler and the analysis judge the same requests against
# different budgets and neither says so.
#
# EXP-104 SNAPSHOT of run_exp103_interleave.sh, taken 2026-08-26 for FluidServe
# v0.3. Two arms added (`fsv3`, `fsv3noaff`) and ONE STRUCTURAL CHANGE: every arm
# now starts from the v0.2 configuration written out explicitly.
#
# Why that change. v0.3 moves four compiled defaults -- affinity-metric to
# `count`, per-instance-correction, memory-uses-pace-cap and
# prefill-interleave-aware to true. set_scheduler_profiling.py REMOVES an
# ablation flag the invocation did not ask for, returning it to the compiled
# default, so after the flip every arm that does not name those four would
# silently acquire the new behaviour and stop meaning what its existing results
# mean. That is the failure this repository has hit twice already: one arm name
# standing for two configurations depending on when it ran.
#
# So set_arm writes the v0.2 values first and each arm overrides what it needs.
# Every arm is then immune to a default moving under it, in either direction.
#
# EXP-103 SNAPSHOT of run_exp101b_truth.sh, taken 2026-08-26. One arm added:
# `fsinterleave`. Nothing else changed.
#
# EXP-101b SNAPSHOT of run_exp101_delay.sh, taken 2026-08-26 after the control
# condition showed that the scheduler cannot observe the quantity its first-token
# test predicts. Same arms; the difference is the binary, which now logs what
# each placement predicted so the prediction can be joined offline against the
# client's first-token latency.
#
# EXP-101 SNAPSHOT of run_exp100_deadline.sh (itself a snapshot chain back to
# run_exp30_dynamic.sh), taken 2026-08-26 so the original stays editable while
# this runs. Two arms added: `fsdelay` and `fsdeadfix`. Nothing else changed.
#
# EXP-97 SNAPSHOT of run_exp93_shift.sh (itself a snapshot of run_exp30_dynamic.sh),
# taken 2026-08-23 so the original stays editable while this runs. One variant
# added: `shift`, the mix-shift stress trace. Nothing else changed.
#
# EXP-30: the dynamic trace. Rate and mix both move, on the shortened workload.
#
#   ./run_exp30_dynamic.sh smoke                 one arm, the 9-minute flat-rate
#                                                mix cycle, to prove the plumbing
#   ./run_exp30_dynamic.sh ablation [reps]       three arms x the 9-minute flat-rate
#                                                mix cycle: mix moves, rate does not
#   ./run_exp30_dynamic.sh full [reps]           three arms x the 1-hour Azure trace
#
# Why this experiment exists. Every result so far was measured at a fixed rate
# with a fixed mix, and a stationary workload cannot separate a policy that
# adapts from one that does not, because nothing has to be adapted to. Measured,
# PolyServe's partition changes once or twice in an eight-minute condition and
# every change is in the start-up transient, so on a static mix its allocation
# is simply correct and stays correct.
#
# Two traces, varying different things:
#
#   dyn09_short_mixcycle_flat   rate flat at 40 req/s, mix cycles m1-m2-m3-m1 on
#                               two-minute segments. Isolates the mix.
#   dyn60_short_m123            rate 25-75 req/s from four days of Azure minutes,
#                               mix cycles on fifteen-minute segments, one hour.
#                               Both move; this is the workload the design is for.
#
# Reading them together is the point: if the flat-rate run shows no difference
# and the hour-long one does, the effect is the rate rather than the mix, and
# the claim to make is about admission control rather than about partitioning.
#
# Arm is the inner loop and repeat the outer, as always: between-session movement
# on this workload is 0.1 points at 20 req/s and 4.6 at 80 (five PolyServe runs
# across three sessions), which is the same size as the differences under test,
# so arms measured in different sessions cannot be compared.

    # 10,000 ms budget -- 31% low, and low on exactly the side that lets a
    # placement through. That is why EXP-100, which put the test into the
    # feasibility conjunction unchanged, refused 46,186 candidates and moved
    # admitted attainment by 0.1 points: what it refused was already refused by
    # another condition.

    #               decision predicted and what the request realised is already
    #               accumulated by the registry and already added on the holding
    #               path in canWait; --fluidserve-deadline-uses-delay adds the
    #               same bound to the deadline test, so the two paths stop
    #               asking the same question with different quantities, and
    #               --fluidserve-per-instance-delay keeps that residual per

    #               second flag adds is a fleet scalar unless the first is set,
    #               and the fleet scalar is what the measurement says is wrong --

    #               1,265 / 1,520 / 2,564 / 20,022 ms, so it understates by an
    #               order of magnitude exactly the instance that is backlogged.

    #               its first token inside its budget is refused a routed
    #               placement rather than given one and then missing.

    # measured prefill duty cycle.
    #
    # What EXP-101b measured, over the 15,219 deep research placements of one
    # mix-shift hour, joining the scheduler's placement lines to the client's
    # own first-token latency:
    #
    #   the estimate ORDERS the requests almost correctly -- Spearman +0.616
    #   against the post-dispatch time and +0.850 for waited-plus-estimate
    #   against the whole first-token time -- and its SCALE is short in the
    #   tail: realised over predicted is 0.59 at the median and 1.99 at p90,
    #   and the two p90s stand at 6,959 ms predicted against 14,332 realised.
    #
    #   So none of the 2,476 placements that took ten seconds or more was
    #   foreseen: the estimate simply never crosses the ten-second budget,
    #   0.0% of deep research placements, while 16.3% of them are late.
    #
    #   Cut by that score, the achievable operating points are real: refusing
    #   the worst 16.3% catches 69.7% of the late work and the worst 20.0%
    #   catches 84.9%, against 16.3% and 20.0% for refusing at random.
    #
    # The correction is not a constant. The estimate prices prefill STEP time,
    # so it answers how much engine prefill time the work costs rather than
    # when the first token appears, and the difference is the decode the engine
    # interleaves. The duty cycle is that share, is measured per instance, and
    # is already published: 0.43 to 0.46 on an instance carrying a queue over
    # 10,000 tokens, whose reciprocal is 2.2 to 2.3 against the measured 2.06.

    # EXP-105. v0.3 with swe's end-to-end budget at 40 s instead of 30.
    #
    # Why. The three classes' nominal per-token budgets are chat 50 ms, swe
    # about 60 (the 30-second end-to-end budget over an expected 498 tokens) and
    # deep research 100. The first two are ten milliseconds apart, and EXP-104
    # measured what that does: isolation runs as a CHAIN in budget order, chat
    # withdraws to two instances, and then swe -- still nearly as tight as chat
    # -- drags deep research down on the remaining two, so the sort separates
    # them again and swe is the one left over. Its effective instance count in
    # the chat-77% segment is 1.53 and 2.02 against deep research's 2.90 and
    # 2.92, although deep research is twice as numerous there, and it pays with
    # 715 more rejected requests over the hour.
    #
    # At 40 s swe's nominal becomes about 80 ms, so the budgets read 50 / 80 /
    # 100 and mixing chat with swe costs 30 ms of an instance's admissible pace
    # rather than 10. If the chain is what EXP-104 says it is, the second link
    # should weaken.
    #
    # ⚠ It also makes swe EASIER: of the swe requests admitted in EXP-104, 11.1%
    # exceed 30 s and only 2.3% exceed 40. There is a third as much room to move,
    # so this is a sensitivity condition about where the budgets sit, not a
    # better-scoring configuration. Its swe numbers are not comparable with any
    # run scored at 30 s.
