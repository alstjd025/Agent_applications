#
# Why this experiment exists. Every result so far was measured at a fixed rate
# with a fixed mix, and a stationary workload cannot separate a policy that
# adapts from one that does not, because nothing has to be adapted to. Measured,
# PolyServe's partition changes once or twice in an eight-minute condition and
# every change is in the start-up transient, so on a static mix its allocation
# is simply correct and stays correct.
#
# Two traces, varying different things:
#
#   dyn09_short_mixcycle_flat   rate flat at 40 req/s, mix cycles m1-m2-m3-m1 on
#                               two-minute segments. Isolates the mix.
#   dyn60_short_m123            rate 25-75 req/s from four days of Azure minutes,
#                               mix cycles on fifteen-minute segments, one hour.
#                               Both move; this is the workload the design is for.
#
# Reading them together is the point: if the flat-rate run shows no difference
# and the hour-long one does, the effect is the rate rather than the mix, and
# the claim to make is about admission control rather than about partitioning.
#
# Arm is the inner loop and repeat the outer, as always: between-session movement
# on this workload is 0.1 points at 20 req/s and 4.6 at 80 (five PolyServe runs
# across three sessions), which is the same size as the differences under test,
# so arms measured in different sessions cannot be compared.
